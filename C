/**
 * The ways to reach a human that do not depend on the form working.
 *
 * ## Why it is always on screen
 *
 * A form has more ways to fail than it has ways to succeed: a delivery
 * provider outage, an expired key, a mis-set variable, a visitor whose
 * network drops the POST. Every one of those loses an enquiry silently,
 * and at this price point one lost enquiry costs more than the whole site.
 * These channels bypass all of it — plain text a visitor can read, copy or
 * tap, whether or not any server is reachable.
 *
 * ## Why it can still be empty
 *
 * Each channel renders only when its variable is set. A WhatsApp button
 * pointing at a number nobody owns is worse than no button: it looks like
 * a working channel right up to the moment it swallows an enquiry. So an
 * unconfigured deployment shows nothing to the visitor rather than a
 * broken channel or implementation details about what to configure.
